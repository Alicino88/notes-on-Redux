Simple application that displays different views whether the user is logged in or out. Also contains a small counter app.

I coded this project while following along the Complete React Course I am following on Udemy. This is why the code contains lots of notes as this is my very first project with Redux.

The code implements the following concepts:

-Redux
-Redux-toolkit
-useDispatch
-useSelector
-createSlice
-configureStore
